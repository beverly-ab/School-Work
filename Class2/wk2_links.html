<h2><a href="wk2_css.html">CIS122</a></h2>
<p>The course emphasizes the technical design, development and implementation of effective Web sites, and 
students learn what makes a Web site work effectively.  The course teaches XHTML, HTML, and CSS and 
introduces JavaScript. It also introduces software to develop and maintain sites. Students develop and 
maintain their own web sites using these development techniques.  In addition, students learn to work 
effectively with Internet navigation, access tools and analyze the techniques to attract viewers to their 
web site.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.pgrocer.net/PFGCIS159S21.html">  CIS159 </a></h2>
<p>The students in this course will learn to work with an open source database and a programming language to 
support the database.  They will learn the concepts of creating a relational open source database, querying 
the database using standard query techniques including SQL and a programming language and maintaining the 
database.  They will learn to use the database and accompanying programming language in the web environment.</p>
<h2>CIS250</h2>
<p>This course covers the creation of interactive Web sites. Students learn about CGI (Common Gateway 
Interface) and CGI scripts. The course teaches Perl and the unique features it offers to make effective 
CGI applications. Students learn about the protocols that govern Web communication. It also teaches other 
languages used in server processing such as ASP.NET. The course introduces students to XML (Extensible 
Markup language). Students also learn to develop server-side Internet databases that can be accessed from a 
Web site. Prequisite: CIS120, CIS122 or permission of the instructor.</p>
<h2>CIS258</h2>
<p>In this course, students write advanced programs and scripts for server-side Web development building on 
the framework laid in CIS47. They increase their abilities in languages learned and build their skills in 
languages currently used for Web site development. The Web sites they build support databases, data 
collection and passing, selection and advanced Web concepts. Sutents also familiarize themselves with the 
concepts involved in programming for interactive devices other than the web. Prerequisite: CIS250 or CIS159 
or permission of the instructor.</p>
