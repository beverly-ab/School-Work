<h2>The Tutoring and Academic Support Center</h2>

<p>The TASC is dedicated to providing academic support for the entire BCC community. This support 
takes the form of providing one on one tutoring, small group tutoring through the Supplemental 
Instruction (SI) program, and computer instructional, audio-visual and written material. A major 
goal of the TASC is to help students develop independent learning skills in order to achieve their 
educational goals.
The TASC is a service of the Center for Developmental Education (CDE), which assists students at 
BCC to progress from their current level of educational proficiency to a level necessary to achieve 
their academic and career goals. This support takes the form of self-paced courses in reading, 
writing, and math, courses for those whom English is a second language, and support for those who 
have physical and learning disabilities. The TASC supports the needs of students in specific CDE 
courses as well as those from the College at large.
The overall philosophy of the TASC is based on the assumption that students learn in a variety of 
ways and at different speeds. The TASC, therefore, provides assistance through individual 
consultation, multi-media presentations, and computer-assisted instruction. Students coming to 
the TASC can avail themselves of trained personnel who are willing to work with them on an 
individual or small group basis. They can also work on their own utilizing the technology available. In other words, TASC personnel provide support and guidance to students. However, the emphasis is on student choice as to how that can be accomplished. In this way, students are helped to become more independent learners and to recognize that learning occurs in a variety of ways.
Another important element in the philosophy of the TASC is the reliance on peer tutors. While there 
are a number of professionals involved with the Center, the majority of tutors are currently 
enrolled students or those who have recently graduated. It is our feeling that students who need 
assistance will often feel more comfortable asking fellow students for help. It is important in 
this regard that tutors relate to tutees as fellow students. A tutor who projects a feeling of 
“superiority,” will soon turn off those whom they see to help. The concept of peer tutoring is 
well-established in the majority of colleges and universities in this country. Its success is 
based on the concept of “students helping students,” within an organized framework where tutors 
receive proper training and support.
